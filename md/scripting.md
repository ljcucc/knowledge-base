### Work smart, be efficient

This is the main concept of using scripting tools. Don't do the same thing over and over again, try to repeat, reconstruct, reuse them.

## Operate computer by scripting

Operating computer can be many ways, but if you want to operate smart, you should try some scripting:

* for operating and automating GUI and mac, you can try [Apple Script](/apple-script)
* for shells, learn more about here: [Shell Scripting](/bash-scripting)

## Edit by scripting

Not only you can power up your work flow by using scripting languages, you can use **vim** to editing files by scripting directly.
